# Universal Blockchain Framework

**Universal Blockchain Framework** is a minimalistic server for creating and running custom blockchain networks in Go.  
The project is designed for prototyping, research, and education in distributed systems and cryptocurrency technologies.

## Features
- 🚀 Quick deployment of a custom blockchain network “out of the box”  
- 🔒 Cryptographic support using elliptic curves and SHA-256  
- 🌐 Peer-to-peer communication over sockets  
- ⚡ Compact and extensible codebase for experiments and modifications  

## Use Cases
- **Researchers** — test consensus algorithms and networking protocols  
- **Developers** — rapidly prototype fintech and Web3 applications  
- **Education** — lightweight framework for students and engineers learning blockchain fundamentals  

## Getting Started
